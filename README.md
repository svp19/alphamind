A bot that plays Mastermind (A.K.A Bulls and Cows) - a guessing game - using a Randomized Minimax Algorithm.

This repository explores various strategies and techniques to build a game-playing bot for the Bulls and Cows code-breaking game conducted as part of the course
CS 211 Data Structures and Algorithms Lab. Although, many strategies were explored, we only highlight the three main techniques considered by Team Alpha - 

1. Naive Elimination method 
2. Minimax Algorithm
3. Randomized-minimax algorithm with Î± improvisation.
